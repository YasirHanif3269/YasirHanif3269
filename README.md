Hi, Yasir here! I'm a novice Games Developer and Designer who just started his Gamedev journey (and quite frankly does not know what he's doing lmao). I work mainly with Unity C# and Blender. I've always been fascinated by video games and their ability to tell intricate and beautiful stories. I hope to do the same too, in the near future.

My Goals:
Learn the hell out of Games Development
Create Good Quality games and build a decent portfolio
Collaborate with like-minded individuals and build my own little community

My Current Projects:
Currently working on a simplistic 3d Game as a way to understand Unity3D movement.

You can contact me via email: yasir.haneef3269@gmail.com.
